# Laney Rocketry Team - Avionics

This repository hosts the ongoing development of a modular, fault-tolerant **flight computer system** for Laney Rocketry's latest experimental vehicle, a 2-meter high-power rocket designed for a flight duration of approximately five minutes.

The avionics system is focused on safe dual-deployment, real time sensing, and robust data logging, built on the **Arduino Due** platform, and engineered with modularity, clarity, and mission safety in mind.

Current Status: **design and prototyping phase**, with active development underway across firmware architecture, hardware integration, and testing procedures.
