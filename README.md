# Laney Rocketry Team - Avionics

This repository hosts the ongoing development of a modular, fault-tolerant **flight computer system** for Laney Rocketry's latest experimental vehicle, a 2-meter high-power rocket designed for a flight duration of approximately five minutes.

The avionics system is focused on safe dual-deployment, real time sensing, and robust data logging, built on the **Arduino Due** platform, and engineered with modularity, clarity, and mission safety in mind.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current Status (January 2026): **design and prototyping phase**. The system must remain idle on the launch pad for 3–5 hours, detect launch autonomously, and support a total flight duration of ~5 minutes, with apogee reached ~20 seconds after liftoff.

Completed Tasks : 
- ✔ initial circuit design completed in KiCad (see hardware/schematics/)
- ✔ Sensor selection finalized (IMU, barometer, GPS)
